#' @usage tannenbaum
#' @format 5000 iid Gaussians
#' This data set was randomly generated in the course of trying to understand some
#' anomalies in estimating Gaussian location mixture problems with \code{GLmix}.
#' It is used by \code{demo(tannenbaum)} to illustrate that sometimes it is
#' worthwhile to tighten the default convergence tolerance for Mosek.
