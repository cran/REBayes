			Advice to Those Installing REBayes

The REBayes package is now available from CRAN.  However, unlike most R packages
it requires some further installation actions.  In an ideal world, CRAN would
automagically install the Rmosek package as well.  Installation of dependencies
usually work fine, but Rmosek requires some tweaking at install time.  Rmosek
is an interface to the mosek environment of Erling Andersen.  You should install
mosek first, along with its license file before trying to use REBayes.

The academic license is now freely downloadable from 
https://www.mosek.com/resources/academic-license and used to be good for 90 days, 
but now apparently is good for one year.
Just fill in the form and then via email you get a license file (mosek.lic) 
that needs to be moved to  the appropriate place in the mosek directory.
This used to be into the subdirectory licenses, but since version 7 it belongs
in MOSEKHOME.  Of course you need to verify that the mosek executable is in
your path:  try mosek from the shell command line to check this.  It used to
be necessary to define the location of the license file as a shell variable
but this no longer seems necessary either.  Once mosek is installed, the next
step is to install the R package Rmosek.  Since version 7 of mosek there seems
to be some conflict with the CRAN version so you need to download Rmosek from
R-forge rather than CRAN.  See the suggestion on the Rmosek webpage.

Now install REBayes also from CRAN (or source) and all should be well, 
to test you might try as an initial step:

require(REBayes)
demo(GLmix1)

Considerable further detail is available from the mosek and Rmosek documentation.

Installation on windows is more challenging, but can be done with enough patience,
provided that you have compilers etc for Rmosek.
